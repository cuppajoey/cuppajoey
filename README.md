# Hi! I'm Joseph,
a front-end engineer and designer dedicated to continuous learning, creative exploration and self-refinement. I'm smart enough to admit I don't know everything, but I believe in my ability to learn anything.

Professionally, I am an adept developer, with 10 years of experience designing and developing for the front end. While I thrive independently, and am comfortable leading a project from start to finish, I firmly believe the best work is produced through collaborative teamwork.
