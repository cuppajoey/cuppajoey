# Hi! I'm Joseph,
a front-end developer and designer passionate about learning, creating and self-reflection. I'm smart enough to know I don't know it all, yet crazy enough to believe I can learn anything.

I'm confident calling myself a developer, designer, and an artist. Professionally, my focus is front-end software development. With 7+ years designing and developing websites, I'm comfortable carrying a project from start to finish, but I believe the best work is produced by a collaborative team.
